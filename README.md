# HCMUS GPA Calculator Bookmarklet

**Add a feature to Hcmus Portal, calculate and show your GPA**

## What is this?

This is a forked version of GPABookmarlet utility, which is created by [dtrung98's repository](https://github.com/dtrung98/GPABookmarklet). It has been 4 years since the last updated of original repository, and unfortunately I observed some bugs in the booklets. Although they are not computation bugs (which will be more severe), but they can cause some confusion for user (especially there is a bug comes from Portal which GPABooklet has not been updated to deal with).

## List of unsolved bugs

- Deal with a bug comes from Portal, which duplicate some graded courses (GPABookmarklet takes all of duplication for computing).
- Checkbox for select/unselect a course to include in GPA does not work.

## Guideline
